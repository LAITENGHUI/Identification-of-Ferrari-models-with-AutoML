# Identification-of-Ferrari-models-with-AutoML
## Introduction
When my sister sees a nice car, she always asks me what car it is, but I don’t know much about cars. Sometimes when I see my idol post his cool cars, I have to slide down the screen to get information about the car from the comments. Inspired by computer vision, I made this project to recognize cars. Considering the short period, I will only use Ferrari models to do this. This project can discern 42 famous models. You can collect all Ferrari models’ or even other cars’ photos to make a perfect application. Let’s get started!
## What you’ll learn
- How to train an image classification model using AutoML Vision Edge.
- How to run it in an iOS app using Tensorflow Lite.
## Pre-requisites
- Goole Cloud Platform
- A recent version of XCode (v10.2+)
- iOS Simulator or a physical iOS device (v9.0+)
- Tensorflow Lite
## Start
The model is in the folder "example".
More details are in the file "instruction".
